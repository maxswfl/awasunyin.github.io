I used to work for surveillance capitalism, now I work on goods for the public.

I like petting cats in the neighbourhood and giving anime recommendations.

### Stuff I did in the past

Co-founded [Metastate](http://metastate.dev), an R&D company bridging the gap between cutting-edge research in cryptography, PLT, and distributed systems. Also co-founded [Cryptium Labs](https://cryptium.ch), a Proof-of-Stake validator that went live in summer 2018 with physical infrastructure. Previously researcher at Cosmos/Tendermint, and software engineer at Chainalysis, specialized in machine learning.
